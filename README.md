## Lab Questions

## Summary
In this lab we made a multiplexer that was then connected to a demultilplexer. Once those were made in verilog the code was connected to a board that showed how the different switches being turned on would light up the led when the buttons were pushed that correspond to it.
### In plain English describe the function and use of a multiplexer.
The function of a multiplexer is a data selector which means it takes multiple inputs and routes one of them to be the output. The use of this is to be able to take multiple signals to share the output.

### In plain English describe the function and use of a demultiplexer.
The function of a demultiplexer is to take one input and send it to multiple outputs with it working. The use of this is to distribute the input to different outputs.
### What other uses might these circuits have? (Think Shannonâ€™s)
Other uses that these circuits have is that they can decompose a complex function with a demux and then made into simpler sub functions that are used with a MUX.
