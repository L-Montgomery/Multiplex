## Lab Questions

    Summary:
    This lab covered the use of multiplexers and demultiplexers. We used input data to choose our output as button combinations that turned on various LEDs. 
### In plain English describe the function and use of a multiplexer.

  The function of a multiplexer is to take data and combine it into a single output. You will select the input signals, and that is the data that passes through to the output. 

### In plain English describe the function and use of a demultiplexer. 

  A demultiplexer is the opposite of a multiplexer in that it takes a single input signal and distributes the data to several output destinations. 

### What other uses might these circuits have? (Think Shannonâ€™s)

  We can use multiplexers to build Boolean functions as Shannon suggests, which means you can use multiplexers to make any circuit you want.
